Once upon a time, there was a fuzzy robot. People were pretty confused
about this because they had never seen a robot before, nevertheless, a fuzzy
one. The robot came from the stars it claimed, but in reality it came from
the pits of hell itself! How tricky this robot was! It persuaded the town
that it could help them learn more. Ah but the town was actually against
learning and considered it to be a witch! They decided to burn it, but when
the flames touched the robot they didn't dare dream of what was to happen
next....
Amazingly, the robot turned itself into a kebab rack. As people was afraid of the explosion caused by burning electronics, they have left. So the kebab shelf remained on water with all kinds of meat. The smell of kebabs attracts the kds in town. They began to gather around the fire. However, no one knows where did it come from, so no one dares to take something to eat. After a while, the parents found their children missing and began looking for them.

Parents first went to the place where the robot was burned. Hoping for 
some evidence, they started to look around. Then one of them found a child
hiding himself in the woods. All parents came to the boy and asked what
happened. He said, "We heard a whisper. It said, 'Want some kebab? Kebab,
something you would not never taste in the future. Want some kebab?'. So
we moved our steps toward where the whisper comes. Walked into the woods.
Then we saw... we...". The boy then fainted. Parents decided to go into 
the woods. They did not know what would happen to them as they entered.
