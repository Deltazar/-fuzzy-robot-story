Once upon a time, there was a fuzzy robot. People were pretty confused
about this because they had never seen a robot before, nevertheless, a fuzzy
one. The robot came from the stars it claimed, but in reality it came from
the pits of hell itself! How tricky this robot was! It persuaded the town
that it could help them learn more. Ah but the town was actually against
learning and considered it to be a witch! They decided to burn it, but when
the flames touched the robot they didn't dare dream of what was to happen
next...
